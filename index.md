## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering student at Cornell University with hands-on experience in robotics, autonomous systems, and high-performance vehicle design. Through leadership roles in FIRST Robotics and technical work with Cornell Electric Vehicles, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in CAD, machining, and control systems, contributing to award-winning engineering projects. As a published research contributor in UAV fault injection and hazard detection, I bring both practical design skills and analytical problem-solving to complex engineering challenges. I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments and am eager to apply my technical expertise and leadership experience to innovative engineering teams.
