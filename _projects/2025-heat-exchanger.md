For Thermodynamics Class we were asked to analyze a thermodynamic device. I choose a heat exchanger which works by running 2 liquids of different heats through channels designed to maximize shared shared surface area between the two channels. This device is best analyzed as a control volume since the volume in the heat exchanger is constant.

#### Device Change
We were also asked to analyze a change to the device and how it affects the device. For this change I chose to analyze the difference between Parralel and AntiParallel flow. Through this experimantal data of the change in method of flow, I observed a slight increase in the difference between inital and final temperatures for both the hot and cold flow through the heat exchanger in the antiparralel flow as compared to the parallel flow.

#### Analysis

**Assumptions**:  
    - Device is operating at Steady State
    - negligible delta KE and delta PE
    - Constant Cp
