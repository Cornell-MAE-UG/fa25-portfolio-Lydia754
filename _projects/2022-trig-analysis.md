As part of a class project I was asked to design a system made up of a rod, 3 pin joints, and a piston to lift the maximum possible load. This system had to have a rod of length between 50 to 150 cm, 2 pin joints located on the ground, 1 pin joint at any point, and a linear actuator chosen from a catalog.


This is how I solved the problem:
- I solved the problem via parameters and tried different possible values to find the maximum output force
- I selected the IMA 55 RNO5 piston for its maximum force of 8,050 lb.
- I solved for F max in terms of parameters via moment equilibrium about A
- After testing different parameter values in google sheets I found final values of 
            L= 0.5 m
            x = 0.285
            This would produce a maximum Weight that could be lifted of 4588.5 lbs
