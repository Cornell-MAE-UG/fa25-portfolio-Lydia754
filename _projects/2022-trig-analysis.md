As part of a class project I was asked to design a system made up of a rod, 3 pin joints, and a piston to lift the maximum possible load. 


This is how I solved the problem:
- I solved the problem via parameters and tried different possible values to find the maximum output force
- I selected the IMA 55 RNO5 piston for its maximum force of 8,050 lb.
